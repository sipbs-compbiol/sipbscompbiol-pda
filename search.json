This can help with mind-mapping, note-taking and other techniques. It’s also transferable to taking notes from lectures, either live or pre-recorded.\n\nActive Reading - Advice from the University of Lynchburg.\nActive Reading Strategies - McGraw-Hill’s guidance on active reading.\nSeven Active Reading Strategies - Strategies for active reading, from ThoughtCo.\n\n\n\n2.2 Taking effective notes\nIt’s a pain to have to go back to the original material and read through it all/watch it all. Identifying what’s important in the material the first time around is a skill that it’s possible to train and develop.\n\nHow To Take Notes - Three approaches from LifeHack.\nHow To Take Study Notes - Five methods from Oxford Learning.\nStrategies For Taking Good Lecture Notes - The University of Washington’s advice for students.\nTake Effective Notes - Seven strategies from intelligent.com.\nTaking Effective Notes - Advice from the University of Maine.\nThe Best Techniques For Taking Notes - Lifehacker’s advice on note-taking.\n\n\n\n2.3 Essay-writing\nIt can be difficult moving from writing short, concise answers to questions, to longer, academic essay-style writing. There are large numbers of sites out there offering advice (see below), and some key points they have in common include:\n\nAn essay lays out an argument it’s meant to convince the reader of your view.\nYou can only really write about one idea at a time in a sentence or paragraph.\nYou need to present your ideas in an order that makes sense to the reader, so that they understand your argument.\n\nYour ideas should lead on from one to the next.\n\nIn general, a structure that starts broad (set the scene with general context), and becomes narrow (makes the final point) works well.\n\nThis is sometimes called an “inverted pyramid”.\n\nOutline your argument in bullet points (or a mind-map, see below) to check the flow of the logic.\nGet feedback early - earlier than you think!\n\nThe earlier you get advice, the easier it will be to incorporate it, and the less work will be needed to make changes.\nMake use of your friends, family and other students: can they understand the flow, even if the topic is unfamiliar? (and making your text understandable to non-technical people is real and valuable skill)\n\nAcademic Writing - Purdue’s OWL.\nBeginner’s Guide to Writing an Essay - Courtesy of Scribbr.\nHow To Look Clever Without Even Trying - Advice from Cambrdige University about essay-writing.\nStrategies for Essay-Writing - Good advice from Harvard University.\n\n\n\n2.4 Mind-Mapping\nI found mind-mapping useful when I was a student. It let me link topics and ideas in an order that made sense to me and let me see the connections that led from one to the other. That was good for exams, and for just understanding the overall structure of a topic. I know quite a few lecturers who use them to summarise seminars they attend, and others who use the technique to plot out papers and lectures. It doesn’t work for everyone or every topic, but you might find it useful.\n\nMind Mapping - A guide, with links to tools, from Vanderbilt University.\nMind Mapping - How to use Mind-Mapping, from the University of Hull.\nMinmapping - Guidance and links, at Oxford Brookes University."
