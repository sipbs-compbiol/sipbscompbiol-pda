Welcome to the SIPBS CompBiol Group PDA pages!

## What is this site for?

This site is intended to provide a persistent repository of information to support you through Strathclyde's Personal Development Programme for {{< var ay >}}.

::: {.callout-warning}
**This site is a secondary resource!**. Please consult with the official course MyPlace links for submission dates, deadlines, and other timings. Use this site in conjunction with the official information at the links below.

- [BM110: Being a Biomolecular Scientist 1]({{< var myplace.year1 >}})
- [BM214: Being a Biomolecular Scientist 2]({{< var myplace.year2 >}})
- [BM327: Being a Biomolecular Scientist 3]({{< var myplace.year3 >}})
- [BM4: Biomolecular Sciences 4th Year]({{< var myplace.year4 >}})
:::

Information is organised under headings: 

- `PDA Info` links to a calendar with the timings of family and 1:1 meetings.
- `Resources` has a collection of links and articles to help support you in your personal development

## Getting Started

- Please do keep the [Key Dates](calendar.qmd) in mind as you go through the year.
- The [Time Management](time_management.qmd) page has links and advice that may help you manage your time so that you can get some work:life balance, and avoid last-minute stresses
- We're sharing a collection of [Learning Resources](learning_resources.qmd) to augment the syllabus, and maybe help you get a bit of "extra reading" insight into aspects of your studies, or develop skills to save you time and produce more impressive work.
- Our [Software Tools](software_tools.qmd) links are there to compile some of the more helpful - mainly free and open-source - software that might help you in yoru studies.

We also provide advice on [giving scientific presentations](presentation.qmd) - an important component of several modules - and [Science Communication](scicomm.qmd) in general. While tailored towards the BM432 project, the advice is quite general and we hope it will be helpful beyond your course.
