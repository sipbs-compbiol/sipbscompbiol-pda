## Preparing for your talk: checklist

1.  Think about exactly what you want to convey
  - tell a story
  - keep it simple
  - keep the number of results you show small (≈3-4) and the message from each clear

2.  Prepare figures for your slides (the "backbone" of your talk)

::: {.callout-tip}
The figures for your slides will rarely, if ever, be exatly the same figures you present in your thesis. You cannot convey as much information in a slide, so you should simplify figures for your talk such that they can be easily understood by your audience.

Presenting too much data on a single slide can be overwhelming and your audience may disengage or read the slide instead of listening to you.
:::

3.  Introduction: think about what your audience needs to know (context) to understand your work
  - what didn't you know, at the beginning of your project?
  - keep it simple: the minimum to contextualise your story

4.  For each experiment, explain (**in this order**):
  1. what you were trying to do (aim)
  2. how you did it (method)
  3. what you found (results)
  4. what your results mean (significance)

5.  Finish with your conclusions/significance of your work
  - what have you learned?
  - how have you contributed to the field?
  - what would you do as the next step?

6.  Go back through your talk and make sure it "flows" in a logical order

7.  Edit, proofread, improve your slides.
  - ask other students in the group for feedback and incorporate it.

8.  Practice, practice, practice!
  - get your timing right (it always takes longer than you think)

9.  Repeat steps 7 and 8 iteratively until you are happy with your presentation and feel confident in your delivery.
