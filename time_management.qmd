We all have different most effective ways of working and organising our time. Some of this advice may work for you, some may not. That's natural, and it's OK to discard advice that doesn't work. Even terrible lists of advice might have one good thing that works for you.

A lot of what I've seen in common is:

1. Identify what *needs* to be done, and for when
2. Make a plan of your time and put it in writing
3. "Good enough is good enough" - don't spend too much time aiming for perfect
4. Be flexible enough to change plans when necessary
5. Schedule in breaks
6. Reward yourself for completing tasks
7. "Natural breaks" like mealtimes make good boundaries for working on any one task
